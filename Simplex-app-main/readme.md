# **Project completed in the Operations Research course**  
### **Created by:** **Angélica Díaz** and **David Centeno**  
### **Name:** **Simplex**

This project implements the **Simplex algorithm** to solve **linear programming** problems, allowing the user to input an **objective function** with its **constraints**. The program can solve both **maximization** and **minimization** problems with any number of variables and constraints. It handles various edge cases, such as:
- Issues with entering or leaving variables
- Multiple solutions
- Infeasibility and unbounded problems

The user can choose between the **two-phase method** or the **Big M method**.

## **Instructions to compile:**
To run the project, navigate to the "**Simplex_app_main**" folder and execute the "**proyectoSimplex.py**" file.
