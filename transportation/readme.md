# **Project completed in the "Investigación de Operaciones" course**  
### **Created by:** **Angélica Díaz** and **David Centeno**  
### **Name:** **Transportation Algorithms**

This project involves developing a program that applies the transportation algorithms learned in class. The solution consists of two main phases:

## **First phase: Feasible Solution**
- **Northwest Corner Method**
- **Minimum Cost Matrix**
- **Vogel's Approximation Method**

## **Second phase: Optimal Solution**
- **Stepping Stone Method**
- **MODI (u/v) Method**

### **Additional features:**
- The program can solve **degenerate problems**.
- It handles cases with **supply and demand imbalances**.
- It solves problems involving **prohibited routes**.
- It also addresses **transportation problems with maximization**.

## **Instructions to compile:**
To run the project, navigate to the "Transportation-app" folder and execute the "transportation.py" file.
